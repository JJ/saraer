Client server application for creating and reading tickets for events; a QR
gives you a ticket using some unique ID gathered from your user-agent; the new
QR can be scanned and gives you a beer, coffee, refreshment or whatever.

The objective of this system is to gather data about which talks in an event
give you more thirst, and whose unique IDs request more refreshments.
